          <p>
            The LG G6’s features a bold new display format complimented by a cinematic viewing experience, exceptional screen to body ratio, wide angle camera and more.
            The 18:9 format offers more viewing space and a more immersive experience when streaming videos and playing games.
            The LG G6 features Dolby Vision technology. But not only does it support Dolby Vision, the G6 also supports HDR 10, both of which are standards for High Dynamic Range (HDR), the picture quality technology which allows for a wider range of colour and luminosity for a truly immersive viewing experience.
            With dual 13MP rear cameras, including a 125-degree lens on the wide angle, the LG G6 captures panoramic shots that regular phones cameras can’t.
            The LG G6 can go just about anywhere without worry thanks to its IP68 water and dust resistance.

          <p>
            Immerse yourself in a bigger view that still fits comfortably in your hand.
            Galaxy S8 and S8+ break free from the confines of bezels, offering a smooth,
            uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges. To do this, we completely redesigned the phone from the inside out.
            And we embedded the home button under the screen, where it stays hidden until you need it.
            So you get a bigger, unobstructed view without a larger phone.
